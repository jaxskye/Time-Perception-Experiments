# Time-Perception-Experiments
# The function of this experiment is to assess the role of feedback in interval timing reproduction in healthy and brain damaged patients.
# Timing is a latent factor in many cognitive domains including language, memory, planning, and decision making. 
# I hypothesize that feedback can attenuate interval time reproduction, which will improve timing performance. 
# Open this experiment in PsychoPy and select the green circular "Run" button at the top of the coding interface. 
# Follow the on screen instructions to begin the task. 
# Press the space bar to end reproduction epochs.
